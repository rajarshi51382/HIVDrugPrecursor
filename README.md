# HIVDrugPrecursor
This project explores the use of machine learning to assist in early-stage drug discovery for HIV. By leveraging molecular data and predictive modeling, it aims to provide a cost-effective, data-driven method to identify chemical compounds that may inhibit critical HIV-related proteins.
